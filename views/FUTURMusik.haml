%p Players stand in triangle and shake hands in the spirit of good competition. Gleefully they perform the following ritual of anarchy and human destruction:

%p Hit play

%p The music must be played loudly enough to force the players to feel as if they are playing on a freeway against their better judgment

%p 3 players stand on one leg at all times as if limitted by their depressing and overbearing humanity. They race to the marker board from the opposite side of the room. The 3 brazenly, violently, and pointlessly scribble within a defined square using an expo marker, maintaining contact between the marker and board at all times. They do so as if confined by the colossal emptiness of their frantic and petty existence. Scribblers may unavailingly hurl verbal insults. It is a race to fill up the entire square with ink. If at any time the square is completely full it is a race to obtain the eraser and erase the board, redefine the parameters and resume scribbling. If one person falls they are to remain motionless on the floor as if their life has been brought to an end by the mighty power of an inevitable robot dominance over mankind. Cheers!
