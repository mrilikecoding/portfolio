          This application provides a platform for Chicagoans affected by crime to securely and anonymously report how crime is affecting them without fear of reprisal. This particular application was inspired by a play created by Collaboraction, an arts organization I work with frequently.
          The play, and now the application, are attempting to address issues of gang violence endemic to Chicago.

          The app is continually under development.
          In partnership with Collaboraction, we plan on rolling out the Crime Scene Chicago app in early 2014.
