        Jack in the Black Box Theater in Atlanta produced this adaptation of The Tibetan Book of the Dead. Adapted in the 1960s,
        I modernized the original score and developed some cool interfaces and software patches to augment live percussion and guitar.
        I used Pd to program the patches controlled from a controller box I built, as well as Ableton and Reason for additional sequencing and software synthesis.
        I also installed a MIDI interface on my Strat. You can listen to the results below!

          By far the productionâ€™s best quality is its Indian-influenced music,
          composed by Steve Gorn and performed live by Nathan Green and
          Jamie DeDakis on enough exotic instruments to stock a music store.
          Martial drums raise our adrenaline, grand gongs rattle our teeth and a
          couple of times an incongruous jazz saxophone hits bluesy notes that feel refreshingly down to earth.
